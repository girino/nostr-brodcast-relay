# Broadcast Relay Configuration Example
# Copy this file and modify according to your needs
# Load it with: source example.env (or set variables manually)

# REQUIRED: Comma-separated list of seed relay URLs
# These relays will be used for initial discovery and periodic refresh
SEED_RELAYS=wss://relay.damus.io,wss://relay.nostr.band,wss://nos.lol,wss://relay.snort.social,wss://relay.primal.net

# Number of top relays to broadcast events to
# Higher numbers = more coverage, but more bandwidth/connections
# Default: 50
TOP_N_RELAYS=50

# Port for the relay server to listen on
# Default: 3334
RELAY_PORT=3334

# How often to refresh the relay list from seed relays
# Format: duration string (e.g., "24h", "12h", "1h30m")
# Default: 24h
REFRESH_INTERVAL=24h

# How often to perform health checks on relays
# Format: duration string (e.g., "5m", "10m", "1h")
# Default: 5m
HEALTH_CHECK_INTERVAL=5m

# Timeout for initial relay testing during discovery
# Format: duration string (e.g., "5s", "10s")
# Default: 5s
INITIAL_TIMEOUT=5s

# Decay factor for exponential moving average of success rate
# Range: 0.0 to 1.0 (higher = more weight on historical data)
# Default: 0.95
SUCCESS_RATE_DECAY=0.95
